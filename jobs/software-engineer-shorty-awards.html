<h2>Software Engineer - NY - Freelance</h2>

<p>We're looking for a talented Django developer to work on next year's <a href="http://shortyawards.com">Shorty Awards</a> site. 
    The Shorty Awards, now in its 8th year, are the awards for the best of social media.  Past winners include Ricky Gervais, Conan O'Brien, Cory Booker, Grover, Stephen Fry, George Takei and Jerry Seinfeld. The Shortys also honor the best work by brands and media companies on social media. The annual ceremony brings together people in real life from around the world.

<h4>About The Position</h4>
<p>
    You’ll be working with the Shorty Awards production team to execute a major update to the Shorty Awards 
    website.

<p>Our tech stack includes Python, Django, Celery, SASS, Redis, Elasticsearch, Nginx, Ansible, Gunicorn,
    Varnish, and Heroku.</p>

<p>This is a freelance job that can be done mostly remotely.  It'd be ideal if you
    were in New York and could meet us in person.  If not, it'd be best if you were in a US timezone.</p>


<h4>About You</h4>
<p>You'll be successful if you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Have significant experience working on a complex, high-traffic site, particularly at a startup or
        software-as-a-service company.
    </li>
    <li>Have 2-4 years experience with Django, Python, and other software in our tech stack, with a willingness
        to learn in those areas where you have less experience.
    </li>
    <li>Enjoy working with and collaborating with designers, UX experts, and product managers to create outstanding
        features.
    </li>
    <li>Take pride in the quality of the code you write. Your code is readable, testable, and understandable
        six months later. You adhere to the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Are able to manage complexity in a large project, and incur technical debt only after considering the
        tradeoffs.
    </li>
    <li>Work well in a fast-paced development environment with testing, continuous integration and multiple
        daily deploys.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to apply</h3>
<p>Send us an email to <a href="mailto:jobs@sawhorsemedia.com">jobs@sawhorsemedia.com</a> with a cover letter explaining
    how you fit the bill for the requirements listed above.
    Include links that demonstrate your best work, whether it's a project you
    created on Github, website you built, software you created, a blog you've written, or something you've made in a
    completely different medium.</p>
