<h2>Front-End UI Developer</h2>

<p><a href="http://sawhorsemedia.com">Sawhorse Media</a> is looking for a talented front-end developer to work on
    <a href="http://muckrack.com">Muck Rack</a>.
    Muck Rack is our software-as-a-service product that connects journalists with PR pros, companies and sources.
    You’ll be creating important user-facing features, working alongside the design, tech and product
    management teams.</p>

<p>
    This is a job that’s ideal for designers who also code, and love crafting HTML, SASS, CSS, user interfaces, and
    style guides.
</p>


<h3>About You</h3>

<p>You'll be successful if you:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Have a good UI design sense, and are capable of wireframing and building user interfaces in HTML and SASS.
    </li>
    <li>Are a master of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, overcoming their constraints while still maintaining and
        improving our standardized framework for other front-end coders or developers to use.
    </li>
    <li>Are an expert at creating responsive HTML that renders well on both desktop and mobile.
    <li>Have JavaScript experience. jQuery at the minimum, but Backbone, Underscore and other frameworks are a plus.
    <li>Write front-end code that is well-written, modular, efficient, and easy-to-understand. You take pride in the
        quality of the code you write.
    </li>
    <li>Have fluency with the terminal and command line, git and Github, and basic Unix commands.</li>
    <li>Have several years professional experience successfully shipping consumer or software-as-a-service products.
    </li>
    <li>Enjoy working with and collaborating with visual designers and product managers to create outstanding features.
    </li>
    <li>Are able to manage complexity in a large project, and incur technical debt only after considering the
        tradeoffs.
    </li>
    <li>Can build and maintain live style guides.
    <li>Have experience working on a Django site. While we’re not expecting you to write backend code, we’d like you to
        have a familiarity working with Django views and templates and forms, and running Django sites locally on your own
        computer. If you have the equivalent experience with another framework and are open to learning Django, that could also
        work.
    </li>
    <li>Can work well with remote developers and team members.
    </li>
    <li>Use a Mac or Linux as your development machine.
    </li>
</ul>
